# The Honking Chronicles

In morning mist by water's edge,
A goose stands proud upon the ledge.
With feathers white and head held high,
It watches clouds drift through the sky.

**Honk!** goes the call, both sharp and clear,
A sound that all the park can hear.
With webbed feet waddling to and fro,
The goose patrols where tall reeds grow.

In V-formation, when they fly,
They paint their patterns cross the sky.
Through seasons changing, north to south,
Adventure calls from every mouth.

But beware the guardian of the lake,
Who'll chase you for a bread crumb's sake.
With wings spread wide and angry hiss,
The goose reminds you: *This is bliss.*

For in their honks and waddle-walks,
Their splashy swims and silly squawks,
These feathered friends both fierce and free,
Remind us what pure joy can be.

---

*A tribute to geese everywhere - majestic, silly, and slightly terrifying.*
